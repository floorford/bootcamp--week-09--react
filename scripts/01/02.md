# Day 1: Afternoon

## Props
- Not reusable
- Show `Figure` component
- Image and caption hard-coded
- Show passing in with props
- Update to use props
- Explain props a bit: gets passed in as object
- Destructuring props
- Show multiple `Figures`: `https://goo.gl/FYXPaS`
- Explain one-way data flow: don't need to know about parent
- Show using string, number, boolean, array, object literal
- Update `Header` to pass in title and sub-title
- Use ternary operator to only show subtitle sometimes: add `margin-left`
- Example of putting something between `<h1>` tags
- Children props: update `Header`
- Show passing in `Funding`
- ReactRouter/React-Redux all use passing in elements with `children`
- `defaultProps`: `Caption Here` and `http://via.placeholder.com/350x350`
- Default props only used if the prop is not present, not for falsey values
