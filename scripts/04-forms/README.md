# Day 3: Morning

- Go through challenges from yesterday

## Structure of Day
- Forms
- React Router

## Forms [20 mins]
- Need to be careful with inputs
- State should track *anything* that changes, including the value of an input
- Need to update the state, otherwise we can't edit the input
- Use the `currentTarget` property from the event object
- Make sure you bind the event handler
- **Controlled component**
- Add a "Length:" bit to demonstrate advantage of keeping in state
- `onChange` is more like `input` event type
- `defaultValue` property
- `value` works for `<select>` and the like
