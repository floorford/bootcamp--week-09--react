# Day 4

- Go through challenges from yesterday

## Structure of Day
- Pre-Built Components
- Deployment

## Pre-Built Components [5 mins]

- one way data flow means can use component anywhere in app
- can use in *any* React app
- large ecosystem of components
- rely on documentation

### React Bootstrap [15 mins]

- include Bootstrap CSS file
- `npm install react-bootstrap`
- Demonstrate basic `<Button>` with `variant`
- Documentation is key
- DOM props get passed through
- Add an `onClick` handler to `<Button>`
- Redo `<Figure>` with BS
- Mention React Native: if you use components for everything, not limited to HTML


### React Datepicker [5 mins]

- writing date picker is hard
- `npm install react-datepicker`
- `import "react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css";`
- uses `Date` objects
- `<DatePicker selected={ date } onChange={ this.handleDate } />`
